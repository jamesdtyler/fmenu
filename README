fmenu — fast menu
=================

fmenu is a generic and efficient menu for X11.


History
-------

fmenu is based on the http://suckless.org/[suckless project]’s
http://tools.suckless.org/dmenu[dmenu]. However, dmenu seeks to be as minimal
as possible and therefore does not include any features but the most basic
ones.

We like the suckless community and agree with their decision, but some people
may want to use things like an alternative matching algorithm or a vertical
layout. In the past, this was only possible by manually patching your dmenu
version, which is not very convenient. Therefore, we decided to fork dmenu and
create a version that is not quite as tiny, but includes all the features the
community finds necessary.


Requirements
------------

In order to build fmenu you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------

Edit +config.mk+ to match your local setup (fmenu is installed into the
+/usr/local+ namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install fmenu (if necessary
as root):

  make clean install


Running fmenu
-------------

See the man page for details.
